    <h3>Check PNR Status:</h3>
    <p>The Indian Railway PNR, also known as the Passenger Name Record, is a number that contains a passenger's personal information. It contains the itinerary for the individual passenger or group of passengers travelling together. It specifies whether the ticket has been confirmed, is on the waiting list (WL), or is reserved against cancellation (RAC). Apart from the basic information about train arrival and departure times, it provides details about the coach and seat number, class of travel, chart status, train name, train number, booking status, current status, journey time, and fare</p>

      <p> Ans-Each train ticket, whether purchased online or at a ticket counter, is assigned a 10-digit PNR number. IRCTC PNR status number is sent via email and SMS for online ticketing. The PNR status is displayed on the upper left-hand side of the printed ticket for physical ticket bookings. This PNR number is required to inquire regarding PNR status, add Trip, and use many other appealing RailYatri services</p>  
        <br><br>

        <h3>Q 4.How to check PNR Status at RailYatri.in?</h3>
        <p>Ans- In the search box above, enter your PNR. When you click the 'Check PNR Status' button, you will see the most recent status of your PNR. Please keep in mind that in order to receive automatic PNR Status change updates and alerts, you must agree to give RailYatri access. You can also install the RailYatri app for faster status change updates.</p>
     <br><br>

     <h3>Q 5.How to check PNR number by SMS?</h3>
     <p> Ans-We recommend using the search box above to look for Railway PNR status on our website, which is completely free. If you're not online, try sending an SMS to 139 using the format below. Send the text "PNR 10 digit PNR Number >" to 139. Please note that carrier charges would apply for SMS service</p>
      <br><br>

      <h3>Q 6.How often should I check for PNR Status Updates?</h3>
      <p>Ans-If you have a waitlisted train ticket, your waitlist number usually gets updated to lower waitlist or confirmed state when passengers with confirmed tickets cancel their tickets. This change is often real time, and thus you should be checking for updates more often on this page. Alternatively, you can install RailYatri App and get automatic notifications for PNR Status.</p>
      <br><br>

      <h3>Q 7.Where can I find the PNR number on a train ticket?</h3>
      <p>Ans-The PNR number will be printed on the top left corner of the train ticket if it is purchased at a railway station. If the train ticket is purchased online, the PNR number will be displayed individually on the top of the train ticket.</p>
      <br><br>

      <h3>Q 8. How does PNR work for train ticket booking?</h3>
      <p>Ans-The Centre of Railway Information Systems(CRIS) runs a database where all information about passengers are fed and stored. A 10 digit PNR number is generated whenever an Indian Railways ticket gets booked online (via IRCTC), or offline at ticket counters. The PNR generated remains valid till the end of the trip. After a certain period old PNRs are flushed out of the CRIS database.</p>
      <br><br>

      <h3>Q 9.What are the possibilities of my waitlisted train ticket getting confirmed?</h3>
      <P>Ans- The availability of waitlisted seats is determined by ticket demand on specific days. As a result, ensuring ticket confirmation is rather tough. You may also use RailYatri's PNR prediction feature to find out how likely your waitlisted tickets are to be confirmed. You can see it in percentages like 50%, 70%, and 45%. The larger the proportion, the greater the chance of confirmation.</P>
      <br><br>

      <h3>Q 10.I have a Reserved or Confirmed Ticket but no Coach or Seat Number is given. What should I do?</h3>
      <p>Ans-If your ticket was previously on the waitlist but is now confirmed, you will be assigned a seat at the time of chart preparation. For example, if the PNR Status reads 10WL/CNF, your ticket's current status is confirmed. Once the chart for the train journey is prepared, you will be assigned Coach and Seat. Typically, the chart is prepared four hours before the train departs from its origin station. Even if you are not boarding at the origin station, you can expect an update on your seat number four hours before train arrival.</p>
